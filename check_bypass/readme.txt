# Exercise 321: Bypassing checks through attacker controlled numbers

Bypass checks in code by causing mathematical operations to overflow, wrap or
truncate.

Task:

* Review the code in check_bypass.cpp.
* Uncomment the checks in the tests in check_bypass.tests.cpp and guess argument
  values that will bypass the if check in the functions in check_bypass.cpp.
